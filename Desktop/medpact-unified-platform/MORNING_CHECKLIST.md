## Option 1: Complete Rebuild ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Result:** All 16 features working perfectly

**Steps:**
1. Open this project in VS Code
2. Tell me: "Let's do Option 1 - complete rebuild"
3. I'll create all 7 features systematically
4. We'll test each feature
5. Deploy to Vercel

## Option 2: Quick Deploy  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Result:** 9 foundation features + broken survey features

**Steps:**
1. Tell me: "Deploy what we have"
2. I'll commit current code
3. Push to GitHub
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. You'll have SOMETHING live (but incomplete)

## Option 3: Check medpact-saas
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Result:** Unknown - depends what's there

**Steps:**
1. Tell me: "Check medpact-saas for survey features"
2. I'll analyze what exists
3. Copy compatible code
4. Test and deploy

## What to Tell Me When You're Ready

Just say ONE of these:
- "Option 1" = Complete rebuild
- "Option 2" = Quick deploy  
- "Option 3" = Check medpact-saas
- "Start fresh" = I'll guide you through Option 1

**No rush. The code is safe. We just need focused time to finish properly.**
